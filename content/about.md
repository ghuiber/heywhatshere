This is an experiment. I use R and RStudio for data analysis at work and around the house. When one day I figured that it would be nice if I could use them for blogging too, it didn't take too long to find the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. Then it occurred to me that it would be nice if I had some specific topic too. San Francisco, where I live now, has an [open data portal](https://datasf.org/) as one would expect. I wonder how easy it is to nose around and tell some stories about what's there.
